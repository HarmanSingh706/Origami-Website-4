            <li>While annual cicadas can be found throughout the world, periodicals are unique to North America.Periodical broods are concentrated in the central and eastern regions of the United States, and some areas are home to multiple broods.</li>
            <li>Names: People call these cicadas “locusts” but they are not true locusts — real locusts look like grasshoppers. The phrase “17 year cicada” indicates that they arrive every 17 years. The name “periodical cicadas” indicates that they arrive periodically and not each and every year.</li>
            <li>Fungus: The Massospora fungus infects Magicicadas, filling their abdomens and destroying their ability to reproduce. Often, their entire abdomen will fall off. The cicadas actually spread the fungus throughout their local colony via mating — the Massospora fungus is a cicada STD!</li>

            <li>Camels are social animals who roam the deserts in search of food and water with up to 30 other individuals.</li>
            <li>With the exception of rutting males competing for females, camels are very peaceful animals who rarely exhibit aggression.</li>
            <li>Contrary to popular misconception, camels do not store water in their humps. The humps are actually reservoirs for fatty tissue. Concentrating fat in their humps minimises insulation throughout the rest of the body, thus allowing camels to survive in such extreme hot regions.</li>

            <li>Giant pandas (often referred to as simply “pandas”) are black and white bears. In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains of central China – you can check out our cool facts about China, here!
            </li>These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.
            <li> Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
            <li>The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.</li>
            <li>Panda's are known for eating bamboo's and you will find them hang onto one or eating one.</li>

            <li>All bears are considered omnivores—and yes, they all love the taste of honey—but each species has a preferred diet.</li>
            <li>Among the biggest threats to all species of bears is habitat loss, especially from logging, agriculture, and growing human populations.</li>
            <li>During winter, when food is scarce, most bears have an effective survival solution: hibernation, a physical state in which the heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, and respiration is lowered. </li>
            <li>SIZE: 4 to 8 feet tall WEIGHT: 60 to 1,600 pounds</li>
            <li>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).</li>

                <li>Diet. Chameleons eat insects and birds. To catch their prey, they creep along very slowly. Once the prey is in reach, their suction cup tongue.</li>
                <li>Habits. Most chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap around tree branches. Their hands and feet have large toes that help them</li>
                <li>171 species of chameleons. With so many different species, there.</li>
                <li>The largest chameleon is the Parson’s chameleon, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. It can grow up to 27 inches (69.5 centimeters) long.</li>
                <li>Unlike other animals, chameleons continue to grow throughout their lives. As their old skin gets too small, they will shed it in bits and pieces, dissimilar to snakes that shed their skin all at once.</li>

                    <li>Pigeons are fed by many members of different religions including Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs for spiritual reasons. Some older Sikhs will ceremoniously feed them in honour of Guru Gobind Singh, a high priest who was renowned as a friend to pigeons.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>
